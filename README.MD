# lib_myfltk
Utility functions that are based on the FLTK.rs crate.
   
## Description
I wrote the functions in this crate to help with other projects on which I am working.  While my main focus has been on my primary project -- Question Bank Creator -- these functions are and will be useful in other situations.  That's why I have kept them in a separate crate.

## Word of Caution
These functions tend to be weak on error handling.  My suggestion is to copy the code into your project and then modify from there.  Better than building from scratch.  I think.  Have fun!
