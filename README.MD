# lib_file
Utility functions that are based on the FLTK.rs crate.
   
## Description
I wrote the functions in this crate to help with other projects on which I am working.  While my main focus has been on my primary project -- Question Bank Creator -- these functions are and will be useful in other situations.  That's why I have kept them in a separate crate.

## Word of Caution
These functions tend to be weak on error handling.  My suggestion is to copy the code into your project and then modify from there.  Better than building from scratch.  I think.  Have fun!

## Good Intentions
I really hate it when coders don't document their work well.  Yet, here I am doing the same.  These functions are quite useful and it may well be that other Rust coders will find them useful.  If that turns out to be the case, I'll return here and try to do a better job documenting them.
