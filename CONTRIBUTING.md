## Standards

   * Keep the code as simple and uncomplicated as possible.  This is as much for my sake as for other contributors.  
   
   * Document your code.  In this I'd have to encourage you to NOT follow my example.  I'm slowly trying to add explanatory comments, but haven't done a very good job of it in the past.
